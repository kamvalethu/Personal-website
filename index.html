      <h3>How did it started</h3>
<h4>Anthony Tiffith as the record producer </h4>
      <p>In 1997, Anthony Tiffith began as a record producer, who had produced for rappers such as The Game and Juvenile, among others. In 2003, Tiffith found a then 15-year-old Kendrick Lamar, a Compton native, who at the time went by K-Dot and had just released his first mixtape, which gained recognition and earned the young rapper a buzz in his local area.

<h4>Artist of the Label</h4>       
 In 2009, Los Angeles-based rapper Schoolboy Q signed with TDE after being affiliated with the label since 2006. In 2009, once they were all signed to the label, Schoolboy Q suggested that he, Lamar, Rock and Ab-Soul form a rap group. They all agreed and all four artists formed the hip hop group Black Hippy.

The Roger Crozier Saving Grace Award was an award in ice hockey given annually to the goaltender who finished the regular season with the best save percentage in the National Hockey League. A goaltender's save percentage represents the percentage of shots on goal that he stops, and is calculated by dividing the number of saves by the total number of shots on goal. The award was first presented at the conclusion of the 1999â€“2000 season, and was named in honor of former Detroit Red Wings, Buffalo Sabres and Washington Capitals goaltender Roger Crozier. The winner of the trophy received a commemorative crystal trophy and was given US$25,000 to donate to a youth hockey or other educational program of their choice. As of 2007, after which it ceased being presented, the award had been handed to six different players on seven occasions. Marty Turco (pictured) is the only goaltender to have won the award twice.
